# Welcome to the VespaRobotics 2025/2026 Repository!

## Intro

Vespa Robotics is a FRC Robotics team that was first created in 2019. This repository holds our code for the season. 
A repository is essentially something that contains all data, code, and information researched for a certain reason, for us that is robotics.


## General Rule of Thumb
### Only programming team executives inside the Club would by default have write access to this, and generally you should create a pull request to allow executives to review the code written and push them for you. This is to prevent untested or bad code to be pushed into the main repository, which would be used on the robot during competition.
