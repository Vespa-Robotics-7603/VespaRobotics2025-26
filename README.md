# Welcome to the VespaRobotics Repository
### DO NOT PUSH CODE TO THIS REPOSITORY, THIS IS FOR REFERENCE ONLY
### Here you would see the archived code that we had in season 2024-25.

## Path References
#### `Custom_Swerve` is for our custom implementation of Swerve drive that is derived from the code that is generated from the CTR Phoenix Tuner X from CTR Electronics
#### `Final swerve` is the code that we had used during competition in McMaster, possibly the most up to date version of the code that we are currently using
#### `FinalSwerver (Semi-working` is the old version of the above folder
#### `generatedCode` is the first version of our code that had been used for initial test of how does the swerve drive drivertrain works, and only had been preliminarily tested at school
#### `swerve_testing` is the experimental code that we had used, the testing grounds of our swerve drive

### For more references, check out the `VespaRobotics2024-25` repository, which would includes all of the old branches that are used to develop the competition code that is used during the 2024-25 FRC Season "REEFSCAPE"
