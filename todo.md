this will be all lees issues he still needs to fix
? means not a confirmed idea

1. fix turning to go
        /       \


        \       /
    on the robot instead of tank drive turn
    be able to constantly rotate wheels while moving the car forward

2. brake for left trigger?
    reduce movement progressively to zero even while using other buttons

3. speed up for right trigger?
    increase movement progressively like a car gas pedal
    increase past the 1/5 speed cap
    slow down progressively when released or acceleration not kept

4. fix pid thing going from 0 to position in 2 seconds
    the current motor turning speed is always assumed to be 0
    so that may be causing it to under/overshoot or turn too fast
