1. fix turning to go
        /       \

    be able to constantly rotate wheels while moving the car forward

2. deccelerator right trigger per req of liliana

3. fix pid thing going from 0 to position in 2 seconds

4. pid constant

5. test and debug new swerve methods
    the constants and logic of the new methods need testing (like turnWheelsTo namely)
